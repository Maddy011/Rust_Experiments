In Linus or macOS:
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

You might need to restart the current bash shell, use the command:
$ exec bash

You will also need a linker, which is a program that Rust uses to join its compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a linker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend on C code and will need a C compiler.

On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:
$ xcode-select --install

Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their distribution’s documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install the build-essential package.

# Troubleshooting

To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this line:
$ rustc --version

# Updating and Uninstalling
$ rustup update
$ rustup self uninstall

# Local documentation
The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it offline. Run rustup doc to open the local documentation in your browser.

Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you’re not sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out!
